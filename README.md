# IASC-2P02 -- Evan Wallace

## Biography

I am a second year student in the Interactive Arts and Science program found at Brock University. My research area is media archaeology and my research program involves challenging ideas of emerging technologies through reflection of past technological influences and effectively referencing academic material to maintain accuracy throughout projects. This research focus is reflected in my projects within this portfolio, such as my featured academic presentation on Surveillance, done in pecha kucha format, that looks at current day surviellance issues within our everday lives. Similarly, my collaborative project looks at how we can create massive personal reference libraries to keep an accurate academic database of references to ensure accuracy when formulating conclusions surrounding emerging technoligies. I'd like to continue with media archaeology in the future through tehcnological outlets like interface design and production, and analyse trends found in their respective fields to help push the future of their industries.
