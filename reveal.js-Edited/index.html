				By changing these two slides into a split four slides, it gives me the opportunity to go more in depth on each of the specific tools used to keep civilians complacent in the world George Orwell has created. I felt that due to the small number of slides I was forced to use during my initial presentation, I was not able to articulately explain how each of these four separate tactics play a role in creating a docile civilization. This is important, as the focus of the presentation is to analyse media archaeology, and to do so the speaker must have a well rounded explanation of the hypothetical technologies we are comparing and contrasting to. This
I also felt that the information not pertinent to the slides should be moved to each individual speaker note for its given slide. This was done, as I feel like the information can be useful, however, can be articulated as opposed to visually expressed. 
This edit will add two slides to my final presentation, and in doing so, will give the speaker more time to set the basis for what information from George Orwell’s book will be actively compared to real world technologies through the lens of Media Archaeology. (I made this closer to 200 words as this description is for two slide additions to the original 18.)

				It can be expected to think that we are being surveyed for external threats to our country through corporations like the government or the NSA, on grounds of terrorism and mass attacks on everyday citizens, but what does it mean when a giant corporation has access to the same types of information?
It is crazy to think that one company can have the power to achieve such a level of systematic surveillance from so many different aspects, and yet does not get held to the same standards as government agencies. They have the ability to mould portfolios about individuals surrounding many facets of their lives, sometimes even including when they are or aren’t home.

					<h2>Facebook and Cambridge Analytica</h2>
					<p>Parent company of Cambridge Analytica "Strategic Communication Laboratories" accessed users profiles through Amazons Mechanical Turk job posting website. </p>
					<p>The main purpose of this data mining strategy was to help categorize personality traits and link them to political ideologies of facebook users, regardless of if they were a Mechanical Turk worker or not</p>
			</section>
				
			<section>
					<h2>Seeding</h2>
					<ol>
						<li >Recruit an employee from MTurk to do a survey that grants access to their facebook account</li>
						<li >Access all individuals information</li>
						<li >Access their friends open accounts in search of similar information</li>
						<li >Gather information about all available users personal preferences and locations</li>
						<li >Analyze where they fall on a personality chart</li>
					</ol>
						
			</section>
			<section>
					<p>Through these practices, Cambridge Analytica was able to gain access to around 50 million facebook accounts using only 270,000 Facebook accounts.</p>

					<h2>The impact of this surveillance</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Ben Carson was found to have payed 220,000 dollars to recieve this information to influence voters.</li>
						<li>Ted Cruz was found to have payed 750,000 follars to recieve this information to influence voters. </li>
						<li>Cambridge Analytica was found to have ties with the recent Trump election</li>
						<li>Cambridge Analytica was found to have ties with the recent Brexit movement</li>

					<h2>Media Archaeology</h2>
						<p>Media Archaeology lends itself to the process of Modernity (Parikka, 2012), and thus we have to reflect on the digital environments we surround ourselves with. With the rise of capitalism, we have to be more aware of the disadvantages that come with being a product in the eyes of businessmen in the social media sectors. </p>
