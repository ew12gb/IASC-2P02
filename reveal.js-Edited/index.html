					<h2>Facebook and Cambridge Analytica</h2>
					<p>Parent company of Cambridge Analytica "Strategic Communication Laboratories" accessed users profiles through Amazons Mechanical Turk job posting website. </p>
					<p>The main purpose of this data mining strategy was to help categorize personality traits and link them to political ideologies of facebook users, regardless of if they were a Mechanical Turk worker or not</p>
			</section>
				
			<section>
					<h2>Seeding</h2>
					<ol>
						<li >Recruit an employee from MTurk to do a survey that grants access to their facebook account</li>
						<li >Access all individuals information</li>
						<li >Access their friends open accounts in search of similar information</li>
						<li >Gather information about all available users personal preferences and locations</li>
						<li >Analyze where they fall on a personality chart</li>
					</ol>
						
			</section>
			<section>
					<p>Through these practices, Cambridge Analytica was able to gain access to around 50 million facebook accounts using only 270,000 Facebook accounts.</p>

					<h2>The impact of this surveillance</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Ben Carson was found to have payed 220,000 dollars to recieve this information to influence voters.</li>
						<li>Ted Cruz was found to have payed 750,000 follars to recieve this information to influence voters. </li>

					<h2>Media Archaeology</h2>
						<p>Media Archaeology lends itself to the process of Modernity (Parikka, 2012), and thus we have to reflect on the digital environments we surround ourselves with. With the rise of capitalism, we have to be more aware of the disadvantages that come with being a product in the eyes of businessmen in the social media sectors. </p>
